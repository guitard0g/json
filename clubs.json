We organize student volunteers to work at the shelters, run advocacy campaigns for homelessness issues, and organize an annual winter clothing drive. We're a really tight knit group and everyone here is dedicated to making our community better."},{"title":"What members do on a week-to-week basis","text":"The main activity that our volunteers do is sleep over at homeless shelters. New York City law requires that there always be one person at a homeless shelter overnight who isn't receiving services, otherwise the shelter has to shut down. We provide those volunteers, and keep the shelters open year-round. Sleeping over is a great experience—you get your own room, there's Wi-Fi and a desk to work at (you'll have time to get lots of work done), and you get to hang out with homeless men and women (who are some of the kindest people we’ve ever met). Our shelters are screened for any drug addiction or mental health issues, and there's a security guard on duty, so there's no need to worry about any safety issues—we haven't had an incident in over a decade. If sleeping over isn't your thing, we also run advocacy campaigns (such as phone banking and lobbying), are launching an outreach campaign where we bring food to homeless people in the neighborhood, and run a clothing drive every year. You can choose your preferred activity and commitment level, and we're very open to any new projects or ideas people might have."},{"title":"Yearly projects","text":"Our biggest project involves helping keep two homeless shelters open throughout the academic year. Aside from that, last year we ran a campus-wide clothing drive that brought in nearly a thousand articles of clothing, and this year we're launching two new projects: an outreach program in which we cook and bring food to homeless individuals in the community, and an advocacy program where we meet once a week to call our representatives about homelessness-related issues. Finally, we're incubating a startup—StreetMate (http%//www.streetmate.nyc)—that makes information about homelessness services accessible throughout the city."},{"title":"New member profile","text":"As long as you're interested in helping the homeless, we'd be thrilled to have you!"},{"title":"What members can expect to get out of it","text":"You can expect to get a better understanding of what it means to be homeless in New York City, a refreshing (and often needed) step outside of the Columbia bubble, and really, really rewarding work."},{"title":"Application process","text":"There's a brief training process for individuals volunteering at the shelter, but no application process.
